# Don't know where to start from in python?
# Here are the basics you need to know:
# You just write. Simple as that.
# If you want a method to print something in the screen you don't need the java syntax for declaration
# See the example below.
x = 4
print(x)
#Or in a loop:
for i in range(0,x) :
    print(i)
